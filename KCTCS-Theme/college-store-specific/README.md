# College Store Specific Data

This directory houses data and assets that are unique to the KCTCS StoreConnect implementation. Use this space to store configuration files, content, and other resources that are specific to the KCTCS college store network.

## Directory Structure

Each college has its own subdirectory for organizing assets, along with a `kctcs` folder for resources shared with the main KCTCS site.

Every store folder includes an `HTML Head Content Block` subfolder where you can place the head content specific to that storefront (for example, Salesforce CMS exports or reusable snippets).
